        <div class="project">
            <h3> Video Games </h3>
            <h4> Since I was younger, my family and I have played Super Mario Bros., Mario Kart, and Just Dance on the Wii.
            I also love classic DS games like Nintendogs, Luigi's Mansion, and Animal Crossing. </h4>
            <h4> With my friends, I enjoy co-op games including Minecraft, We Were Here, 
            Death Road to Canada, and Content Warning.</h4>
            <h4> My favorite types of games to play on my own are platformers (Cuphead, Celeste, Hollow Knight), \
            puzzles (Paper Trail), and narrative-based (Gris, Stray, Papers Please).</h4>

            <h3> Tabletop Games </h3>
            <h4> My family and I always play Korean traditional games like 윷놀이 (Yutnori) and 화투 (Hwatu). 
            We also have a collection of board games including, of course, Scrabble and Monopoly.</h4>

            <h4> I have danced since I was 3 years old! I have trained in many styles including ballet, jazz, and tap.
            I am currently the vice-president of Case Western Reserve University's hip-hop dance club. I am also a part
            of the Undivided hip-hop competition team and the Klover dance group. </h4>
