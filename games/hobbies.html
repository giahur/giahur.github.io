        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Besides designing games and websites, I also enjoy...</p>
        <div class="project">
            <h3> Video Games </h3>
            <p> Since I was younger, my family and I have played Super Mario Bros., Mario Kart, and Just Dance on the Wii.
            I also love classic DS games like Nintendogs, Luigi's Mansion, and Animal Crossing. </p>
            <p> With my friends, I enjoy co-op games including Minecraft, We Were Here, 
            Death Road to Canada, and Content Warning.</p>
            <p> My favorite types of games to play on my own are platformers (Cuphead, Celeste, Hollow Knight), 
            puzzles (Paper Trail), and narrative-based (Gris, Stray, Papers Please).</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="project">
            <h3> Tabletop Games </h3>
            <p> My family and I always play Korean traditional games like 윷놀이 (Yutnori) and 화투 (Hwatu). 
            We also have a collection of board games including, of course, Scrabble and Monopoly.</p>
            <p> I also love doing puzzles, both in-person and online.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="project">
            <h3> Dance </h3>
            <p> I have danced since I was 3 years old! I have trained in many styles including ballet, jazz, and tap, but discovered my favorite style (hip hop) in university.
            I was the vice-president of Case Western Reserve University's hip hop dance club, Undivided. 
            I also competed with their competition team and we won first place at Dance Stomp Shake and second place at Reign or Shine. 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7RcOH3g6sE" target="_blank"> Watch our routine here! </a> </p>
            <p>Currently, I am part of RIT's Hip Hop Dance Collective and Velocity Urban Dance Crew. </p>
