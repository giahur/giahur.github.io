            <p> 2-D narrative-driven pixel puzzle game using Unity and C# </p>
            <p> Play as a pretty princess fixing up her castle with her magic wand. The more she fixes, the more... things go wrong?
            Explore her castle and investigate strange discrepancies to learn the truth behind the sparkles and magic. </p>
            <p> This project was the work of a team of 9 students, including developers, artists, and sound designers. 
            We worked on this project for 15 weeks with weekly sprints. 
            I led puzzle development, conceptualizing and implementing many of the game's interactive puzzles. </p>

            <p> 2D Puzzle Platformer using Unity and C# </p>
            <p> For years you thought you were the last time traveler left. But suddenly, someone starts
            wreaking havoc in the past and it's up to you to stop them. Switch between the past and present 
            to avoid obstacles, fight enemies, and solve puzzles to face whoever is responsible.</p>
            <p> I worked on this project with a group of 4 students over the course of 4 weeks. I designed many of the puzzles and crafted the levels.
            I also implemented assets for characters, enemies, and the environment.</p>

            <p> I worked in a team of 4 students, completing this project in 12 weeks. It combines user input and a matching algorithm to 
            calculate the best roommate options based on habits and preferences. I led

            <p> Website to play Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend! Made using React, JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript, and HTML </p>
            <p> Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a complex version of the classic game with nine 3x3 boards to create an ultimate large board. 
            Each of your moves will determine where your opponent can play next. Wins on the smaller boards count as moves on the larger board. 
            Win the whole game by getting 3-in-a-row on the large board!</p>
            <p> I developed this interactive web application using React framework. I also incorporated React Hooks (state management) to 
            handle game logic such as tracking and updating game state across multiple boards, handling tie conditions, 
            and indicating the next allowed moves. </p>
