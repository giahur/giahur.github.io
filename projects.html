            <h4> I conceptualized and implemented the game's interactive puzzles. 
            I also integrated many of the environmental assets to ensure cohesive game design.
            This project was the work of a team of 9 students, including developers, artists, and sound designers. </h4>

            <h4> Website to play Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend! Made using React, JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript, and HTML </h4>
            <h4> Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a complex version of the classic game with nine 3x3 boards to create an ultimate large board. 
            Each of your moves will determine where your opponent can play next. Wins on the smaller boards count as moves on the larger board. 
            Win the whole game by getting 3-in-a-row on the large board!</h4>
            <h4>I developed this interactive web application using React framework. I also incorporated React Hooks (state management) to 
            handle game logic such as tracking and updating game state across multiple boards, handling tie conditions, 
            and indicating the next allowed moves. </h4>

            <h4>I worked on this project with a group of 4 students. I designed many of the puzzles and crafted the levels.
            I also implemented assets for characters, enemies, and the environment.</h4>
