            <h4> 2-D narrative-driven pixel using Unity and C# </h4>
            <h4> Play as a pretty princess fixing up her castle with her magic wand. The more she fixes, the more... things go wrong?
            Explore her castle and investigate strange discrepancies to learn the truth behind the sparkles and magic. </h4>
            <h4> I conceptualized and implemented the game's interactive puzzles. 
            I also integrated many of the environmental assets to ensure cohesive game design.
            This project was the work of a team of 9 students, including developers, artists, and sound designers. </h4>

            <h3> Ultimate </h3>
            <h4> Website to play Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend! Made using React, JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript, HTML </h4>
            <h4> Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a complex version of the classic game. 
            In each square of the traditional 3x3 board, there is another 3x3 board. 
            Think carefully before making a move, because each of your moves will determine where your opponent can play next.
            Wins on the smaller boards count as moves on the larger board. Win the whole game by getting 3-in-a-row on the large board!</h4>
            <h4>I developed this interactive and visually appealing web application using React framework.
            I styled the user interface with React Router and CSS for easy navigation between pages and an intuitive layout.
            I also incorporated React Hooks (state management) to handle game logic such as tracking and updating game state across 
            multiple boards, handling tie conditions, and indicating the next allowed moves. </h4>
